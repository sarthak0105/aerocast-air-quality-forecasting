# 🚀 Air Quality Forecasting System - Deployment Guide

## What We've Built While Your Model Trains

While your model is training, we've completed the entire production-ready infrastructure:

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. **Model Service Integration** (`src/services/model_service.py`)
- Automatic model loading from `models/` directory
- Fallback to intelligent dummy predictions when models aren't ready
- Support for multiple pollutants (NO2, O3)
- Uncertainty quantification
- Feature engineering integration

#### 2. **Enhanced API** (`api/routes/forecast.py`)
- Connected to model service (no more hardcoded dummy data)
- Real prediction endpoints with proper error handling
- Location validation for Delhi NCR region
- Uncertainty estimation support

#### 3. **Web Interface** (`static/index.html`)
- Interactive map for location selection
- Real-time forecast visualization with Chart.js
- Responsive design with professional UI
- Quick location presets for major Delhi areas
- Live forecast charts for NO2 and O3

#### 4. **Deployment Automation** (`scripts/deploy.py`)
- One-command deployment for local or Docker
- Automatic dependency installation
- Directory setup and validation
- Built-in testing after deployment

#### 5. **Testing & Monitoring**
- **API Testing** (`scripts/test_api.py`): Comprehensive endpoint testing
- **System Monitoring** (`scripts/monitor.py`): Health checks and performance monitoring
- **Batch Forecasting** (`scripts/generate_forecast.py`): Grid and location-based predictions

#### 6. **Production Features**
- Static file serving for web interface
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Global exception handling
- Structured logging throughout
- Docker containerization ready

## 🎯 Quick Start (Once Your Model Finishes)

### Option 1: Instant Deployment
```bash
# This will install everything and start the server
python scripts/deploy.py --mode local
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# For production-like environment
python scripts/deploy.py --mode docker
```

### Option 3: Manual Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start server
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## 🌐 Access Points

Once deployed, you'll have:

- **🏠 Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
  - Interactive map-based forecasting
  - Real-time charts and visualizations
  - Professional UI for end users

- **📚 API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
  - Interactive Swagger UI
  - Test endpoints directly
  - Complete API reference

- **🔍 Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
  - System status monitoring
  - Uptime and performance metrics

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

```bash
# Run comprehensive API tests
python scripts/test_api.py

# Monitor system health
python scripts/monitor.py --mode single

# Generate batch forecasts
python scripts/generate_forecast.py --mode locations
```

## 📊 Model Integration

When your trained model is ready:

1. **Save your model** to the `models/` directory:
   ```
   models/
   ├── lstm_no2_model.h5
   ├── lstm_o3_model.h5
   ├── scaler_no2.pkl
   ├── scaler_o3.pkl
   └── feature_engineer.pkl
   ```

2. **Restart the API** - it will automatically detect and load your models

3. **The system will switch** from dummy predictions to real ML predictions seamlessly

## 🔧 Configuration

Key settings in `config/settings.py`:
- `TARGET_VARIABLES`: Pollutants to predict
- `DELHI_BBOX_*`: Geographic boundaries
- `MODEL_VERSION`: Version tracking
- `FORECAST_HORIZON_HOURS`: Prediction timeframe

## 📈 Production Considerations

### Performance
- Model service caches loaded models
- Efficient feature engineering pipeline
- Async API endpoints for scalability

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error handling and recovery

### Security
- Input validation for coordinates
- Geographic boundary enforcement
- CORS configuration
- Error message sanitization

## 🎉 What's Ready Now

Even without your trained model, the system is fully functional:

1. **Web Interface**: Beautiful, interactive forecasting dashboard
2. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints working with intelligent dummy data
3. **Documentation**: Complete API docs and examples
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite
5. **Deployment**: One-command deployment scripts
6. **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring

The system gracefully handles the transition from dummy predictions to real ML predictions once your model training completes!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy now** to see the full system in action
2. **Test the web interface** and API endpoints
3. **When your model finishes**, simply copy it to `models/` directory
4. **Restart the API** to switch to real predictions
5. **Run tests** to verify everything works perfectly

Your air quality forecasting system is production-ready! 🌟
